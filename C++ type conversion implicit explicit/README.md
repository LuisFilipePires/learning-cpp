### What is C++ type conversion?

### Type Conversion in C++

This project demonstrates **type conversion** (casting) in C++ — converting one data type to another.

- **Implicit conversion:** done automatically by the compiler.  
- **Explicit conversion:** manually forced using `(type)` or `static_cast<type>()`.

Examples include:
- Converting `double` → `int`
- Casting `int` ↔ `char`
- Using type casting to get accurate results in arithmetic operations.

Output shows how different conversions affect the values.
